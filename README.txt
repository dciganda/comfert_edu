This repository contains the data and R code needed to reproduce the results in:
"Reversal in the Association Between Educational Attainment and Fertility Not Driven by Changes in Behavior"

The file `main.R` in the `local` directory allows to runs the estimation algorithm in a `local`
computing cluster.

The file `main.R` in the `remote` directory manages the computation in an external cluster running on Slurm.

The file with the model code `comfert.R` can be found in the `run` directory.
